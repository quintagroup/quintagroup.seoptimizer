quintagroup.seoptimizer 3.0 was tested with Plone 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3.

Note
----

* For Plone 2.0, 2.1, 2.5 versions - use Plone SEO 1.7.1  release (http://plone.org/products/plone-seo/releases/1.7.1)

* For Plone 3 version and up - use Plone SEO releases starting from 2.0.2 release (http://plone.org/products/plone-seo/releases/2.0.2)

* Starting from quintagroup.seoptimizer > 2.0.2 version global keywords support feature dropped - the following fields were removed from SEO Configlet: additional_keywords, settings_use_keywords_lg, and settings_use_keywords_lg. As a result, removed global keywords are now mixing with local ones from seo_context view.
